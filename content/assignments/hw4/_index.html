<ul>
<li>Create a <strong>two minute screencast with narration</strong> showing what
you did for HW3 with some slides.</li>
<li>Upload the video to an online video-platform such as YouTube or Vimeo.</li>
<li>Use your groupXYZ_2018_hw4â€™s Github repository to upload
<ul>
<li>the slides (PDF or HTML formats, no Powerpoint/Keynote files),</li>
<li>the Rmarkdown file that you used to generate the slides
(if you choose to use the concepts presented April 30th),</li>
<li>and a REAMDE (txt format) with the link to the video.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Please make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sound quality of your video is good.</li>
<li>You are not running longer than 2 minutes (we will strictly enforce the time limit).</li>
<li>You use principles of good storytelling and presentations to get your key points across.</li>
<li>You focus the majority of your screencast on your main contributions rather than on technical details:
<ul>
<li>Make sure the main contributions are upfront and center rather than at the end.</li>
<li>What insights did you gain?</li>
<li>What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
