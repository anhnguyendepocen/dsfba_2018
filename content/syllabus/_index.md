## Course Readings

There will be no mandatory reading. However, weekly readings related to the
[lectures](/lectures/) are strongly recommended, 
and [additional ressources](/ressources/) 
will undoubtedly be useful.

## Evaluation

Evaluation will be based on four assignments (50%) and a final project (50%). 
For each assignment as well as the project, 
students will have to provide detailed written reports. 
Additionally, for the project, students will give a presentation during 
the last lecture.

The final grade will be calculated using the following formula: 
$$GRADE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{4} HW_i \cdot 12.5 + PR \cdot 50}{100},$$ 
where $HW_1$, $HW_2$, $HW_3$, $HW_4$, and $PR$ are respectively 
the grades for the assignments and final project, on a scale from 0 to 100. 
This final grade will then be adjusted on a scale from 1 to 6.

### Retake exam

The retake consists in asking the failing students to make modifications
or additions to their written reports and to present them.
